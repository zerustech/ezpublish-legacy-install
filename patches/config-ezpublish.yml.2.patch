+    # However, the view provider approach has been re-implemented since "ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel:6.0.0"
+    # and these classes are not compatiable with the new approach and have been deprecated, so if we keep
+    # the tags on them, they will cause runtime errors when previewing contents.
+    #
+    # But at this moment, some other service(s) still depend on them, so we can't remove the definition completely yet.
+    # As a workaround, we detached the tags from them to fix the content preview issue and also don't break the other
+    # services.
